*** The manual is tested on Ubuntu 18.04 ***

Server side:

1. Set up MySQL:
(See this guide if something isn`t clear: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-mysql-on-ubuntu-18-04)

    1.1 Install mysql-server package
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mysql-server
sudo mysql_secure_installation          //several steps of initial setup

    1.2 Set up MySQL invironment (user, database, tables):
sudo mysql              //opens MySQL shell
CREATE USER '<your user name>'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<your password>';         //ex: CREATE USER 'myuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'VeRySeCuRePaSsWoRd';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO '<your user name>'@'localhost';                      //<your user name> is previousely created user

CREATE DATABASE <your db name>;
use <your db name>;
CREATE TABLE block_producer (id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, account_name VARCHAR(12) NOT NULL UNIQUE);
CREATE TABLE voter (id BIGINT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, id_bp INT NOT NULL, account_name VARCHAR(12) NOT NULL UNIQUE, FOREIGN KEY (id_bp) REFERENCES block_producer(id));

    1.3 Add block producer to block_producer table.
INSERT INTO block_producer (account_name) VALUES('<BP account name>');          //ex: INSERT INTO block_producer (account_name) VALUES('atticlabeosb');

2. Set up node server:
(See this guide if something isn`t clear: https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-18.04/)

    2.1 Install nodejs:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs npm

    2.2 Run nodejs server:
put sources to <your server folder>
cd <your server folder>
npm install                 //install all dependencies
node index.js

    2.3 Config setup:
Path: <your server folder>/config.json
Server config has the next structure:
{
	"eos": {
		"httpEndpoint": "<host address>",           //address of node. Ex: http://dev.cryptolions.io:38888 (for Jungle testnet)
		"chainId": "<chain id>",                    //ex: 038f4b0fc8ff18a4f0842a8f0564611f6e96e8535901dd45e43ac8691a1c4dca (Jungle testnet)
		"systemContractAcc": "eosio",               //system contract
		"systemVotersTable": "voters"               //voters table name on system contract
	},
	"db": {
		"host": "localhost",
		"user": "<your user>",                      //
		"password": "<your password>",              //for this fields use values from section 1.2

	}
}


Front-end:

1. Set up front-end:

    2.1 Install Scatter to your browser:
Follow this guide: http://www.blockchainexpert.uk/blog/how-to-set-up-scatter-for-eos

    2.2 Install nodejs:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs npm

    2.3 Run nodejs server:
put sources to <your front-end folder>
cd <your front-end folder>
npm install                 //install all dependencies
npm start

    2.4 Config setup:
Path: <your front-end folder>/src/config.json
Config has the next structure:
{
	"eos": {
		"blockchain": "eos",
	    "host": "<host address>",                   //address of producer. Ex: dev.cryptolions.io (for Jungle testnet)
	    "port": <host port>,                        //port of producer. Ex: 38888 (for Jungle testnet)
	    "protocol": "http",
	    "chainId": "<chain id>"                       //ex: 038f4b0fc8ff18a4f0842a8f0564611f6e96e8535901dd45e43ac8691a1c4dca (Jungle testnet)
	},
	"http": {
		"host": "",									//server address
		"port": "3001"                              //server port
	}
}


Usage:
Open web page.
	'New voted' and 'New unvoted' fields are showing how many voters left unnotificated.
	In max transactions field you can write how much notifications can be executed after one 'Send' click.
The minimum value is 1, the maximum value is 1000.
	In 'BP Account' field write your (as block producer) account name.
	In drop-down field select 'Voted' if you want to send memo to all accounts who recently had voted for you
or 'Unvoted' if you want to send memo to all accounts who recently had taken their votes off you
	In Memo field write a message that will be sent with notification
	Press 'Send' button to send notifications.
If an error occurs when interacting with server, simple pop up will be shown.
After pressing 'Send' the pop up with number of successfully sent notifications will be shown.

After you pressed 'Send' button a Scatter window will pop up.
Select your account identity (the one that you entered into 'BP Account' field) and press 'Accept' button.
    Note: To not to press 'Accept' for every notification,
    before pressing 'Accept' button you must put this action to whitelist.
    To do this you need to switch checkbox under 'Do you want to whitelist this contract action?'.
    After that new checkboxes will appear. Check 'to' and 'memo' checkboxes.
    Finally, press 'Accept'.

Note: Every notification is a transfer of "0.0001 EOS" to voter.
